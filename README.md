#Cyclistic 
#In this project we have a problem, we do not know the differences of Cyclistic clients, there are two types, casual and members, the clients are those who use the bicycles but do not have a membership and the members do have a membership, the objective of this project is to know the differences in bicycle use behavior between these 2 types of clients to try to convert them.
